# Jarvis OS (Governed)

Jarvis OS is a single-core assistant system with modular capabilities, governed by strict policies and permission gates.

## Goals
- Local-first execution
- Network OFF by default (allowlist-only when enabled)
- Permissioned actions (approval gates)
- Append-only audit logging
- Secrets never appear in code, commits, or logs

## Non-Goals
- No always-on autonomous internet agent
- No telemetry
- No implicit installs/deploys/messaging without approval

## Architecture (high-level)
- Governor: policy enforcement, permissions, approvals, kill switch, audit rules
- Planner: reasoning + stress tests + plans
- Manager: orchestration + routing
- Operator: executes approved skills
- Skills Registry: explicit tool contracts
- Audit Log: append-only event log

## Repo Rules
- Protected main branch (PR-based)
- Governance files are treated as source-of-truth

## How to run
1. Ensure Node.js 18+ and the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) are available.
2. Review or edit `jarvis.config.json` (network stays OFF by default).
3. Build: `npm run build`
4. Run:
   - List skills: `node dist/cli/index.js skills`
   - Read a file: `node dist/cli/index.js run read_file --input '{"path":"README.md"}'`
   - Write a file (requires approval + allowlist): \
     `node dist/cli/index.js run write_file --approve --input '{"path":"data/example.txt","content":"hello"}'`
